# SnappFood Clone
Welcome to the SnappFood Clone project! This project is a comprehensive food delivery platform, inspired by the popular SnappFood app. It's designed to simulate the experience of using a food delivery service, featuring sections for sellers, admins, and customers. The customer section is particularly noteworthy as it's implemented as a REST API using the Django REST Framework.

# Features
- Seller Section: Allows sellers to manage their listings, make, view, and manage orders, and update their inventory. After registration, each seller will get a welcome email sent via Celery and Redis.
- Admin Section: Provides administrative tools for managing users, sellers, and overall platform settings.
- Customer Section: Implemented as a REST API, this section allows customers to register, view restaurants, view foods, make and submit order carts, get and post comments, rate restaurants and manage their orders through a secure and efficient interface.
